## Model Summary

This submission implements a classical, continuous-time, event-driven price
process. The model is fully specified by the Python implementation and generates
the q-variance relationship endogenously from the price dynamics, without
imposing the quadratic form by construction.

Price dynamics are driven by stochastic shock activity rather than by a
diffusive volatility process. Volatility is not modelled directly; instead, it
emerges from the realised aggregation of random shocks.

## Simulation Overview

Price paths are generated by simulating a latent precision process, mapping this
to a stochastic shock intensity, and aggregating a random number of Gaussian
shocks each day. This construction ensures that conditional variance increases
with realised price movement and naturally produces the q-variance relationship
across time horizons.

## Latent Precision Process

A positive latent process `tau` is simulated using a CIR-type diffusion:

dτ = κ(θ − τ)dt + η√τ dW


This process is stationary and strictly positive. High values of `tau`
correspond to calm market regimes with low activity, while low values correspond
to turbulent regimes with elevated activity. Mean reversion ensures regime
persistence while preventing degeneracy.

In the implementation:
```python
tau = tau + kappa * (theta - tau_pos) * dt + eta * np.sqrt(tau_pos) * dW_tau

Shock Intensity and Returns

Daily shock intensity is defined as an inverse function of precision:
